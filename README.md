## Features

- **Support a wide range of microcontrollers**: Powered by [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy), RMK supports a wide range of microcontrollers, such as stm32/nRF/rp2040/esp32
- **Real-time keymap editing**: RMK has built-in [Vial](https://get.vial.today) support, the keymap can be changed on-the-fly. You can even use Vial to edit keymap over BLE directly
- **Advanced keyboard features**: Many advanced keyboard features are available by default in RMK, such as layer switch, media control, system control, mouse control, etc
- **Wireless**: BLE wireless support with auto-reconnection/multiple devices feature for nRF52 and esp32 microcontrollers, tested on nRF52840, esp32c3 and esp32s3
- **Easy configuration**: RMK provides a simple way to build your keyboard: a `keyboard.toml` is all you need! For experienced Rust user, you can still customize your firmware easily using RMK
- **Low latency and low-power ready**: RMK has a typical 2 ms latency in wired mode and 10 ms latency in wireless mode. By enabling `async_matrix` feature, RMK has very low power consumption, with a 2000mah battery, RMK can provide several months battery life

## Usage

### Option 1: Initialize from template
You can use [rmk-template](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk-template) to initialize your project.

```shell
cargo install cargo-generate flip-link
cargo generate --git https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk-template
```

Then follow the steps in generated `README.md`. Check RMK's [User Guide](https://haobogu.github.io/rmk/user_guide/1_guide_overview.html) for details.

### Option 2: Try built-in examples

Example can be found at [`examples`](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/blob/main/examples). The following is a simple step-to-step instruction for rp2040. For other microcontrollers, the steps should be identical with a debug probe.

#### rp2040

1. Install [probe-rs](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs)

   ```shell
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/releases/latest/download/probe-rs-tools-installer.sh | sh
   ```

2. Build the firmware

   ```shell
   cd examples/use_rust/rp2040
   cargo build
   ```

3. Flash using debug probe

   If you have a debug probe connected to your rp2040 board, flashing is quite simple: run the following command to automatically compile and flash RMK firmware to the board:

   ```shell
   cd examples/use_rust/rp2040
   cargo run
   ```

4. (Optional) Flash using USB

   If you don't have a debug probe, you can use `elf2uf2-rs` to flash your rp2040 firmware via USB. There are several additional steps you have to do:

   1. Install `elf2uf2-rs`: `cargo install elf2uf2-rs`
   2. Update `examples/use_rust/rp2040/.cargo/config.toml`, use `elf2uf2` as the flashing tool
      ```diff
      - runner = "probe-rs run --chip RP2040"
      + runner = "elf2uf2-rs -d"
      ```
   3. Connect your rp2040 board holding the BOOTSEL key, ensure that rp's USB drive appears
   4. Flash
      ```shell
      cd examples/use_rust/rp2040
      cargo run
      ```
      Then, you will see logs like if everything goes right:
      ```shell
      Finished release [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.21s
      Running `elf2uf2-rs -d 'target\thumbv6m-none-eabi\release\rmk-rp2040'`
