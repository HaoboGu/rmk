## Features

- **Broad microcontroller compatibility**: Leveraging [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy), RMK supports a comprehensive range of microcontrollers, including stm32, nRF, rp2040(w), esp32, etc
- **Dynamic keymap customization**: RMK offers native [Vial](https://get.vial.today) support, enabling real-time keymap modifications. You can even edit keymaps over BLE connections wirelessly
- **Advanced keyboard functionality**: RMK comes with lots of advanced keyboard features by default, including layer switching, media controls, system commands, mouse control, and more
- **Wireless connectivity**: BLE wireless support with automatic reconnection and multi-device capabilities for nRF52 and esp32 microcontrollers, tested on nRF52840, esp32c3, esp32s3, Pi Pico W
- **Easy configuration**: RMK simplifies keyboard development through a single `keyboard.toml` configuration file. For Rust enthusiasts, the firmware remains highly customizable using Rust code
- **Optimized performance**: RMK achieves approximately 2ms latency in wired mode and 10ms in wireless mode. With the `async_matrix` feature enabled, power consumption is significantly reduced—a 2000mAh battery can power your keyboard for several months

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Start with a Template

Quickly bootstrap your project using [rmkit](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmkit) and the official RMK [project template](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk-template/tree/feat/rework).

```shell
cargo install rmkit flip-link
# If you encounter installation issues on Windows, try this alternative command:
# powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/haobogu/rmkit/releases/download/v0.0.13/rmkit-installer.ps1 | iex"
rmkit init
```

For comprehensive guidance, refer to the [User Guide](https://rmk.rs/docs/user_guide/1_guide_overview.html).

### Option 2: Explore Built-in Examples

Browse the examples in the [`examples`](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/blob/main/examples) directory. Below are step-by-step instructions for rp2040 development. The process is similar for other microcontrollers when using a debug probe.

#### rp2040 Setup

1. Install [probe-rs](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs)

   ```shell
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/releases/latest/download/probe-rs-tools-installer.sh | sh
   ```

2. Build the firmware

   ```shell
   cd examples/use_rust/rp2040
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Flash using a debug probe

   With a debug probe connected to your rp2040 board, simply run:

   ```shell
   cd examples/use_rust/rp2040
   cargo run --release
   ```

4. (Optional) Flash via USB

   Without a debug probe, you can use `elf2uf2-rs` to flash via USB:

   1. Install the tool: `cargo install elf2uf2-rs`
   2. Modify `examples/use_rust/rp2040/.cargo/config.toml` to use `elf2uf2`:
      ```diff
      - runner = "probe-rs run --chip RP2040"
      + runner = "elf2uf2-rs -d"
      ```
   3. Connect your rp2040 board while holding the BOOTSEL button until the USB drive appears
   4. Flash the firmware:
      ```shell
      cd examples/use_rust/rp2040
      cargo run --release
      ```
      Upon successful completion, you'll see output similar to:
      ```shell
      Finished release [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.21s
      Running `elf2uf2-rs -d 'target\thumbv6m-none-eabi\release\rmk-rp2040'`
