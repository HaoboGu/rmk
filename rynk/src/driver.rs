//! Protocol driver for Rynk: the [`Client`] with its request and topic
//! methods, and the [`Driver`] that moves the bytes. Sessions are created by
//! [`RynkDevice::connect`](crate::RynkDevice::connect).
//!
//! ## Frame flow
//!
//! A frame is a 3-byte header (`CMD u16 LE | SEQ u8`) plus a postcard
//! payload. On the wire it is COBS-encoded and ends with a `0x00`, so after
//! any garbage the stream finds the next frame boundary again on its own.
//! [`encode_frame`] builds outgoing frames, a [`Deframer`] cuts incoming
//! ones back out of the byte stream, and the driver routes each frame by the
//! topic bit in its CMD:
//!
//! ```text
//! request()    encode → message ─→ Driver: write_all
//! Driver: read → deframe → route by the CMD topic bit:
//!          topic frame → decode → topics ─→ next_topic()
//!          reply frame → SEQ-matched slot ─→ request(): decode
//! ```
//!
//! ## Session lifecycle
//!
//! [`Driver::run`] returns when the link dies. There is no in-band death
//! signal: a call waiting on a dead session never finishes on its own. So run
//! the driver in the same `select` as everything that awaits on the
//! [`Client`] — see the crate docs for how to set this up.
