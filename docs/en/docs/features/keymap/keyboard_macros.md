## Keyboard Macros

rmk supports keyboard macros: Pressing a trigger to execute a sequence of keypresses.

This can be configured via Vial or rust. A configuration via the toml configuration file will be provided in the future.

## Macro operations

The following operations, coming from Vial, can be used to form a macro sequence. They are in `rmk::config::keyboard_macros::keyboard_macro`:

### Text(KeyCode, bool)

Execute a key press from any available KeyCode. The boolean flags if the key should be pressed with the shift modifier.

Note that other modifiers pressed outside of a sequence with `Text` are disabled.

### Tap(KeyCode)

Presses and releases a key. Modifiers pressed outside of a macro sequence are considered as well. If you don't need this prefer `Text(KeyCode, bool)` above, as the resulting macro is 3 times smaller in size.

### Press(KeyCode)

Press (and hold) a keycode. Useful for modifier keys.

### Release(KeyCode)

Release (a formerly pressed) keycode. Useful for modifier keys.

### Delay(u16)

Wait the given time in ms before executing the next macro operation.

### End

This marks the end of a macro sequence. Don't use it: The code removes all occurrences and adds one marker to the end of every sequence to be sure the sequences are terminated correctly.

## Configure a macro sequence

### via the configuration file

This is not yet supported.

### via Rust

A new field `keyboard_macros` has been added to the `BehaviorConfig` struct. Within it a field `macro_sequences` has to be set. This is in binary format (`[u8]`) and can only be as long as `MACRO_SPACE_SIZE`, which is set to 256.

The maximum number of Macros depends on the length of the sequences: The space consumed is MacroOperations \* 3 + Number of Macros (where the operation `text` is only 1/3).

The code is silently cutting anything longer than 256 bytes! So if your last macro is not complete you used too much space.

There are two helper functions to define macro sequences:

1. `define_macro_sequences(&[heapless::Vec<MacroOperation, MACRO_SPACE_SIZE>])` You can use it this way:

```rust
pub(crate) fn get_macro_sequences() -> [u8; MACRO_SPACE_SIZE] {
    define_macro_sequences(&[
        Vec::from_slice(&[
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::H, true),
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::E, false),
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::L, false),
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::L, false),
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::O, false),
        ])
        .expect("too many elements"),
        Vec::from_slice(&[
            MacroOperation::Press(KeyCode::LShift),
            MacroOperation::Tap(KeyCode::W),
            MacroOperation::Release(KeyCode::LShift),
            MacroOperation::Tap(KeyCode::O),
            MacroOperation::Tap(KeyCode::R),
            MacroOperation::Tap(KeyCode::L),
            MacroOperation::Tap(KeyCode::D),
        ])
        .expect("too many elements"),
    ])
}
```

This code defines two macro sequences which produce "Hello" and "World". (As mentioned above prefer the first Macro for text only output. The first macro sequence is 6 bytes long, the second 22 bytes.)

For text output there is a convenience function: `to_macro_sequence(text: &str) -> heapless::Vec<MacroOperation, MACRO_SPACE_SIZE>`.

This function converts a `&str` into a sequence of `MacroOperation::Text`. The above example would be:

```rust
pub(crate) fn get_macro_sequences() -> [u8; MACRO_SPACE_SIZE] {
    define_macro_sequences(&[
        to_macro_sequence("Hello"),
        to_macro_sequence("World"),
    ])
}
```

(With the improvement that the `Text` macro operation is used in both cases.)

Note that you are still limited to the ascii characters defined as `KeyCode`s. For example, you can't enter a German Umlaut (`ü`) or unicode directly with a `KeyCode` binding. If you enter an illegal character it will be converted to `X`.

Entering these special characters usually require a key combination which depends on your operating system and chosen keyboard layout (setting in the OS). For example, in MacOS with a en-US layout you can define the following sequence to enter an `ö`:

```rust
pub(crate) fn get_macro_sequences() -> [u8; MACRO_SPACE_SIZE] {
    define_macro_sequences(&[
        Vec::from_slice(&[
            MacroOperation::Press(KeyCode::LAlt),
            MacroOperation::Tap(KeyCode::U),
            MacroOperation::Release(KeyCode::LAlt),
            MacroOperation::Tap(KeyCode::O),
        ])
        .expect("too many elements"),
    ])
}
```

## Triggering a macro

### Binding

A macro can be triggered in two ways:

1. Using the `KeyCode::Macro0` - `KeyCode::Macro31`.
2. Using the `Action::MacroTrigger(index)`, where index can be any number. If the total number of macro sequences is less than the index passed, nothing is executed (and an error "Macro not found" is logged). Remember that the index starts at `0`.
3. Defined macro sequences are automatically bound to a sequence: The first macro sequence defined is executed when triggering `KeyCode::Macro0` and `Action::MacroTrigger(0)`.

There is no difference using either, other than that there is no `KeyCode::Macro32`. To trigger the 33th macro and above you need to use `Action::TriggerMacro(index)`.

### Combining

Both macro triggers can be used anywhere, where a `KeyCode` or an `Action` can be assigned.

As the only `Action` taking a `KeyCode` is `Action::Key`, combining with `Action`s is limited.

#### With `KeyAction`

You can combine the trigger with any `KeyAction`, like layer-taps, hold-taps, etc.

For example:

```rust
KeyAction::TapHold(k!(Macro0, Acrion::TriggerMacro(1)))
```

Probably you most likely will need

```rust
k!(Macro0)
```

or

```rust
KeyAction::Single(Action::TriggerMacro(0))
```

#### With `Combo` (chording)

Combining with Combo allows for a quite powerful feature: Chording. Chording comes for the courtroom stenography and has its name from playing chords, like on a guitar. Chording is pressing a few letters to emit multiple letters.

Thus, one can press only the beginning of a word to write the whole word. For example, pressing `T` & `Y` could write `type`, pressing `T` & `Y`& `G` could write `typing`. If you want to implement this behavior we recommend using an extra layer, so rolling over `T` and `Y` will not accidentally execute the macro, but only when a layer toggle key is pressed as well.

This is the configuration for the above example, assuming `1` is the chording layer:

```rust
    define_macro_sequences(&[
        to_macro_sequence("type"),
        to_macro_sequence("typing"),
    ])

    CombosConfig {
        combos: Vec::from_slice(&[
            Combo::new([k!(T), k!(Y)], k!(Macro0), Some(1)),
            Combo::new([k!(T), k!(Y), k!(G)], KeyAction::Single(Action::TriggerMacro(1)), Some(1)),
        ])
        .expect("too many combo definitions!"),
        timeout: Duration::from_millis(50),
    }
```

(`Action::TriggerMacro(1)` was used for demonstration only. Using `k!(Macro1)` is recommended to keep it brief.)

Note that instead of having a second macro for all verbs (normal and `ing` form) you can define a macro which converts a word to the `ing` form:

```rust
    define_macro_sequences(&[
        to_macro_sequence("type"),
        Vec::from_slice(&[
            MacroOperation::Press(KeyCode::Backspace),
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::I, false),
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::N, false),
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::G, false),
        ])
        .expect("too many elements"),
    ])

    CombosConfig {
        combos: Vec::from_slice(&[
            Combo::new([k!(T), k!(Y)], k!(Macro0), Some(1)),
            Combo::new([k!(G)], KeyAction::Single(Action::TriggerMacro(1)), Some(1)),
        ])
        .expect("too many combo definitions!"),
        timeout: Duration::from_millis(50),
    }
```

With the configuration above pressing `T` & `Y` writes `type` and pressing `G` changes it to `typing`.

### With forks

You can use macro triggers in forks as well.

This is how you can trigger `hello` and `Hello` with pressing shift:

```rust
pub(crate) fn get_macro_sequences() -> [u8; MACRO_SPACE_SIZE] {
    define_macro_sequences(&[
        to_macro_sequence("hello"),
        to_macro_sequence("Hello"),
    ])
}
pub(crate) fn get_forks() -> ForksConfig {
    ForksConfig {
        forks: Vec::from_slice(&[
            Fork::new(
                k!(Macro0),
                k!(Macro0),
                k!(Macro1),
                StateBits::new_from(
                    HidModifiers::new_from(false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false),
                    LedIndicator::default(),
                    HidMouseButtons::default(),
                ),
                StateBits::default(),
                HidModifiers::default(),
                false,
            ),
        ])
        .expect("Some fork is not valid"),
    }
}
```

## Tips

### Small and capital version of a word

If you want to spell a macro in small letters, but occationally with the first letter capitalized, you can do so in the following way:

For example, you might want to use a combo for the rare letter `q`. And as this letter mostly comes as `qu` you want to use a macro for that.

Thus, implement the macro:

```rust
pub(crate) fn get_macro_sequences() -> [u8; MACRO_SPACE_SIZE] {
    define_macro_sequences(&[
        Vec::from_slice(&[
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::Q, false),
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::U, false),
        ])
        .expect("too many elements"),
    ])
}
```

When you press `shift` and use `MacroOperation::Text`, like in the code above, no letter gets capitalized (outputs `qu`). Remember that `MacroOperation::Text` ignores all modifiers not being part of the sequence. `MacroOperation:Tap` doesn't, thus you can use `MacroOperation::Tap` for the first letter, and `MacroOperation::Text` for the following letters, to capitalize the first letter only.

```rust
pub(crate) fn get_macro_sequences() -> [u8; MACRO_SPACE_SIZE] {
    define_macro_sequences(&[
        Vec::from_slice(&[
            MacroOperation::Text(KeyCode::Q, false),
            MacroOperation::Tap(KeyCode::U),
        ])
        .expect("too many elements"),
    ])
}
```
