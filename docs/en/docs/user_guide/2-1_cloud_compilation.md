# Cloud compilation

RMK provides a [project-template](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk-project-template) that you can use to create your firmware easily. The following is a step-by-step tutorial for compiling RMK firmware using Github Actions.

Note: There are some limitations currently for cloud compilation. For example, you cannot edit cargo features in the generated project. If you have any problems when compiling RMK using cloud, please [open an issue](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/issues/new)!

## Steps

1. To get started, open [project-template](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk-project-template), click `Use this template` button and choose `Create a new repository`:

2. Input your repository name, and click `Create repository`

![create rmk repository](/images/create_repository.png)

3. After the repository is created, there are two config files in the projectï¼š`keyboard.toml` and `vial.json`:

   - `keyboard.toml`: this file defines almost everything about your keyboard, follow [keyboard configuration](/docs/features/keyboard_configuration.md) to create your own keyboard definition
   - `vial.json`: this file contains matrix definitions which will be recognized by [vial](https://get.vial.today/). RMK now uses vial to update the keymap on-the-fly. Follow vial's [porting guide](https://get.vial.today/docs/porting-to-via.html) to create `vial.json` for your keyboard.

   you can edit the files directly on Github by clicking the file and then choosing `edit this file`: ![edit file](/images/edit_config_file.png). After updating your config, click `Commit changes..` to save it: ![commit change](/images/commit_changes.png)

4. Once you saved your file, Github Action will automatically run to compile your firmware using your saved config files. Click `Action` tab on the top bar and you can see there's a workflow running. ![workflow](/images/workflow.png)

   You can also check the compilation log by clicking `build/build`. After the compilation finished, refresh the page and you can see the compiled RMK firmware under `Summary/Artifacts`:

   ![artifacts](/images/artifacts.png)

5. Now you get your RMK firmware! RMK provides `hex` and `uf2` firmware that you can use. The final step is to flash the firmware to your microcontroller. Follow the instructions in [Flash the firmware](3_flash_firmware.md) section.
