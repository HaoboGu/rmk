# Input devices

The definition of input devices varies, but for RMK, we focus on two categories: keys and sensors.

- Keys are straightforwardâ€”they are essentially switches with two states (pressed/released).
- Sensors are more complex devices that can produce various types of data, such as joysticks, mice, trackpads, and trackballs.

## Usage

RMK uses a standard pattern for running the entire system:

```rust
// Create a rotary encoder input device and a processor which processes encoder's event
let mut encoder = RotaryEncoder::new(pin_a, pin_b, 0);
let mut encoder_processor = RotaryEncoderProcessor::new(&keymap);
// Start the system with three concurrent tasks
join3(
    // Run all input devices and send events to EVENT_CHANNEL
    run_devices! (
        (matrix, encoder) => rmk::channel::EVENT_CHANNEL,
    ),
    // Use `encoder_processor` to process the events.
    run_processor_chain! {
        rmk::channel::EVENT_CHANNEL => [encoder_processor],
    },
    // Run the keyboard processor
    keyboard.run(),
    // Run the remaining parts of RMK system
    run_rmk(&keymap, driver, storage, light_controller, rmk_config),
)
.await;
```

Notes:

- If the input devices emit only `KeyEvent`, use only `run_device!((matrix, dev) => EVENT_CHANNEL))` is enough, no `run_processor_chain` is needed. Because all `KeyEvent`s are automatically processed by `keyboard.run()`
- `EVENT_CHANNEL` are built-in, you can also use your own local channels
- The events are processed in a chained way, until the processor's `process()` returns `ProcessResult::Stop`. So the order of processors in the `run_processor_chain` matters
- For advanced use cases, developers can define custom events and procesors to fully control the input logic
- The keyboard is special -- it receives events only from `KEY_EVENT_CHANNEL` and processes `KeyEvent`s only. `KeyEvent` from ALL devices are handled by the `Keyboard` processor, then the other events are dispatched to binded processors

## Implementation new devices

RMK's input device framework is designed to provide a simple yet extensible way to handle both keys and sensors. Below is an overview of the framework:

![input_device_framework](/images/input_device_framework.excalidraw.svg)

To implement a new input device in RMK, you need to:

1. Create a struct for your device that implements the `InputDevice` trait
2. Define how it generates events by implementing the `read_event()` method
3. Use it with `run_devices!` to integrate into RMK's event system

## Input device trait

Input devices such as key matrices or sensors read physical devices and generate events. All input devices in RMK should implement the `InputDevice` trait:

```rust
pub trait InputDevice {
    /// Read the raw input event
    async fn read_event(&mut self) -> Event;
}
```

This trait is used with the `run_devices!` macro to collect events from multiple input devices and send them to a specified channel:

```rust
// Send events from matrix to EVENT_CHANNEL
run_devices! (
    (matrix) => EVENT_CHANNEL,
)
```

> Why `run_devices!`?
>
> Currently, embassy-rs does not support generic tasks. The only option is to join all tasks together to handle multiple input devices concurrently. The `run_devices!` macro helps accomplish this efficiently.

## Runnable trait

For components that need to run continuously in a task, RMK provides the `Runnable` trait:

```rust
pub trait Runnable {
    async fn run(&mut self);
}
```

The `Keyboard` type implements this trait to process events and generate reports.

## Event Types

RMK provides a default `Event` enum that is compatible with built-in `InputProcessor`s:

```rust
#[non_exhaustive]
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug)]
pub enum Event {
    /// Keyboard event
    Key(KeyEvent),
    /// Rotary encoder, ec11 compatible models
    RotaryEncoder(RotaryEncoderEvent),
    /// Multi-touch touchpad
    Touchpad(TouchpadEvent),
    /// Joystick, suppose we have x,y,z axes for this joystick
    Joystick([AxisEvent; 3]),
    /// An AxisEvent in a stream of events. The receiver should keep receiving events until it receives [`Eos`] event.
    AxisEventStream(AxisEvent),
    /// End of the event sequence
    ///
    /// This is used with [`AxisEventStream`] to indicate the end of the event sequence.
    Eos,
}
```

The `Event` enum aims to cover raw outputs from common input devices. It also provides a stream-like axis event representation via `AxisEventStream` for devices with a variable number of axes. When using `AxisEventStream`, the `Eos` event must be sent to indicate the end of the sequence.

## Input Processor Trait

Input processors receive events from input devices, process them, and convert the results into HID reports for USB/BLE transmission. All input processors must implement the `InputProcessor` trait:

```rust
pub trait InputProcessor {
    /// Process the incoming events, convert them to HID report [`Report`],
    /// then send the report to the USB/BLE.
    ///
    /// Note there might be multiple HID reports are generated for one event,
    /// so the "sending report" operation should be done in the `process` method.
    /// The input processor implementor should be aware of this.
    async fn process(&mut self, event: Event);

    /// Send the processed report.
    async fn send_report(&self, report: Report) {
        KEYBOARD_REPORT_CHANNEL.send(report).await;
    }
}
```

The `process` method is responsible for processing input events and sending HID reports through the report channel. All processors share a common keymap state through `&'a RefCell<KeyMap<'a, ROW, COL, NUM_LAYER>>`.


# Input Devices

RMK supports various input devices beyond just key matrices. The input system consists of two main components:

### Input Device Trait

Each input device must implement the `InputDevice` trait, which requires:

- A `read_event()` method to read raw input events

Example implementation:

```rust
struct MyEncoder;
impl InputDevice for MyEncoder {
    async fn read_event(&mut self) -> Event {
        // Read encoder and return events
        embassy_time::Timer::after_secs(1).await;
        Event::RotaryEncoder(RotaryEncoderEvent::Clockwise)
    }
}
```

### Runnable Trait

For components that need to continuously run in the background, RMK provides the `Runnable` trait:

```rust
pub trait Runnable {
    async fn run(&mut self);
}
```

The `Keyboard` type implements this trait to process events and generate reports.

## Input Processors

Input processors handle events from input devices and convert them into HID reports. A processor:

- Receives events from one or more input devices
- Processes those events into HID reports
- Sends the reports to USB/BLE

The `InputProcessor` trait defines this behavior with:

- A `process()` method to convert events to reports
- A `send_report()` method to send processed reports

### Built-in Event Types

RMK provides several built-in event types through the `Event` enum:

- `Key` - Standard keyboard key events
- `RotaryEncoder` - Rotary encoder rotation events
- `Touchpad` - Multi-touch touchpad events
- `Joystick` - Joystick axis events
- `AxisEventStream` - Stream of axis events for complex input devices

### Running Devices, Processors and RMK

RMK provides a standardized approach for running the entire system with multiple components:

```rust
// Start the system with three concurrent tasks
join3(
    // Task 1: Run all input devices and send events to EVENT_CHANNEL
    run_devices! (
        (matrix, encoder) => EVENT_CHANNEL,
    ),
    // Task 2: Run the keyboard processor
    keyboard.run(),
    // Task 3: Run the main RMK system
    run_rmk(&keymap, driver, storage, light_controller, rmk_config),
)
.await;
```

This pattern is used across all RMK examples and provides a clean way to:

1. Read events from input devices and send them to a channel
2. Process those events with a keyboard processor
3. Handle all RMK system functionality in parallel
