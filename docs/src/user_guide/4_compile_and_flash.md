# Compile and flash!

In this section, you'll be able to compile your firmware and flash it to your microcontroller.

## Compile the firmware

To compile the firmware is easy, just run

```shell
cargo build --release
```

If you've done all the previous steps correctly, you can find your compiled firmware at `target/<your_target>/release` folder, whose name is your project's name or the name set in `Cargo.toml`'s `[[bin]]` section.

The firmware generated by Rust has no extension, which is actually an ELF file.

If you encountered any problems when compiling the firmware, please report it [here](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/issues).

## Flash the firmware

The last step is to flash compiled firmware to your microcontroller. RMK supports flashing the firmware via uf2 bootloader or debug probe. 


### Use uf2 bootloader

By default, Rust firmware is an ELF file, so we have to do some extra steps converting it to uf2 format.

RMK uses [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) to automate the uf2 firmware generation.

First, install the `cargo-make` tool:

```shell
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

Generating uf2 firmware also requires you have `python` command available. [Here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) is a guide for installing python.

Then, you should update the chip family argument(aka argument after -f) in `Makefile.toml` in your project. You can get your chip's family ID in `scripts/uf2conv.py`.

That's all you need to set. The final step is to run

```shell
cargo make uf2 --release
```

to generate your uf2 firmware.

#### Tips for nRF52840

For nRF52840, there are several widely used UF2 bootloaders, they require slight different configs.

First, you should check the used softdevice version of your bootloader. Enter bootloader mode, there will be an USB driver shown in your computer. Open `INFO_UF2.TXT` in the USB driver, the content of `INFO_UF2.TXT` should be like:

```
UF2 Bootloader 0.6.0 lib/nrfx (v2.0.0) lib/tinyusb (0.10.1-41-gdf0cda2d) lib/uf2 (remotes/origin/configupdate-9-gadbb8c7)
Model: nice!nano
Board-ID: nRF52840-nicenano
SoftDevice: S140 version 6.1.1
Date: Jun 19 2021
```

As you can see, the version of softdevice is `S140 version 6.1.1`. For nRF52840, RMK supports S140 version 6.X and 7.X. The `memory.x` config is slightly different for softdevice 6.X and 7.X:

```ld
MEMORY
{
  /* These values correspond to the NRF52840 with Softdevices S140 6.1.1 */
  /* FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x00026000, LENGTH = 824K */

  /* These values correspond to the NRF52840 with Softdevices S140 7.3.0 */
  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x00027000, LENGTH = 820K
  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20020000, LENGTH = 128K
}
```

You can edit your `memory.x` to choose correct value for your bootloader.

### Use debug probe

If you have a debug probe like [daplink](https://daplink.io/), [jlink](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/) or [stlink](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink)(stm32 only), things become much easier: connect it with your board and host, make sure you have installed [probe-rs](https://probe.rs/), then just run

```shell
cargo run --release
```

Then the command configured in `.cargo/config.toml` will be executed. The firmware will be flashed to your microcontroller and run automatically, yay!
