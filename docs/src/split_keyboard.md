# Split keyboard

RMK supports multi-split keyboard, which contains at least one central board and at most 8 peripheral boards. The host is connected to the central board via USB or BLE. All features in RMK are supported in split mode, such as VIAL via USB, layers, etc.

## Example

See `examples/use_rust/rp2040_split` and for the wired split keyboard example using rp2040.

See `examples/use_rust/rp2040_split_pio` for the wired split keyboard example using rp2040 and PIO serial driver.

See `examples/use_rust/nrf52840_ble_split` for the wireless split keyboard example using nRF52840.

See `examples/use_config/rp2040_split` and for the `keyboard.toml` + wired split keyboard example using rp2040.

See `examples/use_config/rp2040_split_pio` and for the `keyboard.toml` + wired split keyboard example using rp2040 and PIO serial driver.

See `examples/use_config/rp2040_split` and for the `keyboard.toml` + wired split keyboard example using rp2040 and a direct pin matrix.

See `examples/use_config/nrf52840_ble_split` for the `keyboard.toml` + wireless split keyboard example using nRF52840.

See `examples/use_config/nrf52840_ble_split` for the `keyboard.toml` + wireless split keyboard example using nRF52840 and a direct pin matrix.

**NOTE:** for `nrf52840_ble_split`, add

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
nrf-softdevice = { version = "0.1.0", git = "https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice", rev = "b53991e"}
```

to your `Cargo.toml` if there's compilation error in `nrf-softdevice` dependency.

## Define central and peripherals via `keyboard.toml`

You can also use the [`keyboard.toml`](./keyboard_configuration.md) to define a split keyboard.

All split related configurations are defined under `[split]` section. The following is an example using BLE:

```toml
[split]
# split connection type
connection = "ble"

# Split central
[split.central]
# Central's matrix definition and offsets
rows = 2
cols = 2
row_offset = 0
col_offset = 0

# Central's ble addr
ble_addr = [0x18, 0xe2, 0x21, 0x80, 0xc0, 0xc7]

# Central's matrix
[split.central.matrix]
matrix_type = "normal"
input_pins = ["P0_12", "P0_13"]
output_pins = ["P0_14", "P0_15"]

# Note there're TWO brackets, since the peripheral is a list
# Peripheral 0
[[split.peripheral]]
rows = 2
cols = 1
row_offset = 2
col_offset = 2
# Peripheral's ble addr
ble_addr = [0x7e, 0xfe, 0x73, 0x9e, 0x11, 0xe3]

# Peripheral 0's matrix definition
[split.peripheral.matrix]
matrix_type = "normal"
input_pins = ["P1_11", "P1_10"]
output_pins = ["P0_30"]

# Peripheral 1
[[split.peripheral]]
# Matrix definition
rows = 2
cols = 1
row_offset = 2
col_offset = 2
# Peripheral's ble addr
ble_addr = [0x7e, 0xfe, 0x71, 0x91, 0x11, 0xe3]

# Peripheral 1's matrix definition
[split.peripheral.matrix]
matrix_type = "normal"
input_pins = ["P1_11", "P1_10"]
output_pins = ["P0_30"]
```

When using split, the input/output pins defined in `[matrix]` section is not valid anymore. Instead, the input/output pins of split boards are defined in `[split.central.matrix]` and `[split.peripheral.matrix]`. The contents of the split matrix configuration is the same as for `[matrix]`. This means each peripheral and central keyboard also supports `direct_pin`.

The rows/cols in `[layout]` section is the total number of rows/cols of the whole keyboard. For each split(central and peripherals), rows/cols/row_offset/col_offset should be defined to indicate the current split's position in the whole keyboard's layout. Suppose we have a 2-row + 5-col split, the left(central) is 2\*2, and the right(peripheral) is 2\*3, the positions should be defined as:

```toml
[split.central]
rows = 2 # The number of rows in central
cols = 2 # The number of cols in central
row_offset = 0 # The row offset, for central(left) it's 0
col_offset = 0 # The col offset, for central(left) it's 0

[[split.peripheral]]
rows = 2 # The number of rows in the peripheral
cols = 3 # The number of cols in the peripheral
row_offset = 0 # The row offset of the peripheral, peripheral starts from row 0, so the offset is 0
col_offset = 2 # The col offset of the peripheral. Central has 2 cols, so the col_offset should be 2 for the peripheral
```

If you're using BLE, `ble_addr` is required for both central and peripheral. Each device needs a `ble_addr`.

If you're using serial, in `[split.central]` you need to defined a list of serial ports, the number of the list should be same with the number of the peripherals:

```toml
[split]
connection = "serial"

[split.central]
..
# Two serial ports used in central. The order matters.
serial = [
    # Serial port which is connected to peripheral 0.
    { instance = "UART0", tx_pin = "PIN_0", rx_pin = "PIN_1" },
    # Serial port which is connected to peripheral 1.
    { instance = "UART1", tx_pin = "PIN_4", rx_pin = "PIN_5" },
]

# Peripheral 0
[[split.peripheral]]
..
# Serial port used in peripheral 0, it's a list with only one serial port element.
serial = [{ instance = "UART0", tx_pin = "PIN_0", rx_pin = "PIN_1" }]

# Peripheral 1
[[split.peripheral]]
..
serial = [{ instance = "UART0", tx_pin = "PIN_0", rx_pin = "PIN_1" }]
```

If you're using the Programmable IO (PIO) serial port with an RP2040 chip, subsitute the UART serial port interface with the PIO block, e.g. `PIO0`:

```toml
[split]
connection = "serial"

[split.central]
..
serial = [
    # Half-duplex serial port using Programmable IO block PIO0
    { instance = "PIO0", tx_pin = "PIN_0", rx_pin = "PIN_0" },
]

[[split.peripheral]]
..
serial = [{ instance = "PIO0", tx_pin = "PIN_0", rx_pin = "PIN_0" }]
```

## Define central and peripherals via Rust

In RMK, split keyboard's matrix are defined with row/col number and their offsets in the whole matrix.

### Central

Running split central is quite similar with the general keyboard, the only difference is for split central, total row/col number, central matrix's row/col number, and central matrix's offsets should be passed to `run_rmk_split_central`:

```rust
// nRF52840 split central, arguments might be different for other microcontrollers, check the API docs for the detail.
run_rmk_split_central::<
            Input<'_>,
            Output<'_>,
            Driver<'_, USBD, &SoftwareVbusDetect>,
            ROW, // TOTAL_ROW
            COL, // TOTAL_COL
            2, // CENTRAL_ROW
            2, // CENTRAL_COL
            0, // CENTRAL_ROW_OFFSET
            0, // CENTRAL_COL_OFFSET
            NUM_LAYER,
        >(
            input_pins,
            output_pins,
            driver,
            &mut get_default_keymap(),
            keyboard_config,
            central_addr,
            spawner,
        )
```

In peripheral central, you should also run the peripheral manager for each peripheral. This task monitors the peripheral key changes and forwards them to central core keyboard task

```rust
run_peripheral_manager<
    2, // PERIPHERAL_ROW
    1, // PERIPHERAL_COL
    2, // PERIPHERAL_ROW_OFFSET
    2, // PERIPHERAL_COL_OFFSET
  >(peripheral_id, peripheral_addr)
```

### Peripheral

Running split peripheral is simplier. For peripheral, we don't need to specify peripheral matrix's offsets(we've done it in central!). So, the split peripheral API is like:

```rust
run_rmk_split_peripheral::<Input<'_>, Output<'_>, 2, 2>(
    input_pins,
    output_pins,
    central_addr,
    peripheral_addr,
    spawner,
)
```

where `2,2` are the size of peripheral's matrix.


## Communication

RMK supports both wired and wireless communication.

Currently, the communication type indicates that how split central communicates with split peripherals. How the central talks with the host depends only on the central.

- For communication over BLE: the central talks with the host via BLE or USB, depends on whether the USB cable is connected
- For communication over serial: the central can only use USB to talk with the host


### Wired split

RMK uses `embedded-io-async` as the abstract layer of wired communication. Any device that implements `embedded-io-async::Read` and `embedded-io-async::Write` traits can be used as RMK split central/peripheral. The most common implementations of those traits are serial ports(UART/USART), such as `embassy_rp::uart::BufferedUart` and `embassy_stm32::usart::BufferedUart`. That unlocks many possibilities of RMK's split keyboard. For example, using different chips for central/peripheral is easy in RMK.

For hardwire connection, the TRRS cable is widely used in split keyboards to connect central and peripherals. It's also compatible with UART/USART, that means RMK can be used in most existing opensource serial based split keyboard hardwares.

For keyboards connected using only a single wire, e.g. a 3-pole TRS cable, for the **RP2040 only** RMK implements a half-duplex UART serial port, `rmk::split::rp::uart::BufferedUart`, using one or both of the Programmable IO (PIO) blocks available on the RP2040 chip. The PIO serial port also supports full-duplex over two wires, and can be used when the central/peripheral connection does not use the pins connected to the chip's standard UART ports.

To use the the PIO UART driver feature, you need to enable the `rp2040_pio` feature gate in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
rmk = { version = "0.4", features = [
    "split",
    "rp2040_pio", # Enable PIO UART driver for rp2040
] }
```

### Wireless split

RMK supports BLE wireless split on only nRF chips right now. The [BLE random static address](https://novelbits.io/bluetooth-address-privacy-ble/) for both central and peripheral should be defined.
