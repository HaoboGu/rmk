# Beginners Guide

There are two methods for compiling your RMK firmware:

1. **Cloud compilation**: compile the firmware using Github Actions, no need to install anything to your computer, ideal for new beginners
2. **Local compilation**: compile the firmware at your local machine. This method unlocks more options to do with your firmware, such as using a development version or the Rust API
