# Configuration

RMK provides a simple and declarative way to configure your keyboard using a TOML configuration file, requiring no Rust programming knowledge. You can also use Rust API which offers maximum flexibility and control over your keyboard's behavior.

In this section, we will introduce how to configure your keyboard in detail. The documentation will mainly focus on `keyboard.toml` but still provide Rust API code example if needed.

## `keyboard.toml`

The `keyboard.toml` file is the central configuration for nearly every aspect of your keyboard setup. The following sections can be configured in your `keyboard.toml`:

- **[Keyboard and Matrix](./keyboard_matrix.md)** - Basic keyboard information and physical key matrix definition
- **[Layout](./layout.md)** - Keyboard layout and default keymap configuration
- **[Split Keyboard](./split_keyboard.md)** - Configuration for split keyboard setups
- **[Storage](./storage.mdx)** - On-board configuration and keymap storage settings
- **[Behavior](./behavior.md)** - Advanced keyboard behaviors (one-shot keys, tri-layer, tap-hold, morse key, home row mods, etc.)
- **[Input Devices](./input_device)** - Configuration for rotary encoders, joysticks, and other input devices
- **[Wireless/Bluetooth](./wireless.md)** - Wireless and Bluetooth connectivity settings
- **[Lighting](./light.md)** - RGB lighting and LED configuration
- **[RMK Config](./rmk_config.md)** - Internal RMK settings (./communication channels, macro limits, etc.)
- **[Complete Reference](./appendix.md)** - Full specification and examples for `keyboard.toml`

We also provide pre-configured templates for popular microcontroller chips in the [`rmk-config/src/default_config`](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/blob/main/rmk-config/src/default_config) directory. You can use then when generating project using [rmkit](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmkit). Contributions for additional chip configurations are welcome!

For a complete specification of all TOML configuration options, please refer to the other documentation chapters under `Configuration` section.

## Rust API

All Rust API that RMK provides can be found in https://docs.rs/rmk, you can also refer to `examples/use_rust` in RMK's main repository for comprehensive examples.
