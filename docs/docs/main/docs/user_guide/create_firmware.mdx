# Creating Your Firmware

RMK offers two methods for compiling your keyboard firmware:

### 1. Cloud Compilation

Compile your firmware using GitHub Actions with zero local setup required. This method is perfect for:

- New users who want to get started quickly
- Users who prefer not to install development toolchain locally

### 2. Local Compilation

Compile firmware on your local machine. This method offers:

- Complete control over the build process
- Ability to do more customization or use Rust API
