# Supported Hardwares

Leveraging the great Rust embedded ecosystem, RMK is able to support a wide range of hardware across different architectures, including Cortex-M, Xtensa, and RISC-V.

## Adding Support for New Hardware

RMK can run on any hardware platform with [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) support. To enable specific communication:

- USB Support: Requires implementation of [embassy-usb-driver](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-usb-driver) traits.
- BLE Support: Requires implementation of [bt-hci](https://github.com/embassy-rs/bt-hci) traits.

Once your hardware has the corresponding trait implementations, RMK support will be available out of the box.
