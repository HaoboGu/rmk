# From v0.7.x to v0.8.x

RMK v0.8.x is a major update, including a lot of changes. One notable change is that RMK changed BLE stack to TrouBLE, a great BLE host implementation with async support and better compatibility.

## TODO:

1. `keyboard.toml` migration
2. Dependencies migration
3. Code migration
4. Project config migration
