# Vial support

RMK uses [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) as the default keymap editor. Vial allows you to change your keymapping in real-time, no additional firmware flashing is required.

::: warning
Vial requires the [storage feature](./storage) to persist your keymap data. Without storage feature enabled, any changes to your keymap will be lost after the keyboard reboots.

## Port Vial

To use Vial with RMK, you need a keyboard definition file named `vial.json`. Vial provides detailed documentation on how to generate this file: https://get.vial.today/docs/porting-to-via.html. 

::: Note
When creating your `vial.json`, it is essential that you use the exact same layout definition as your RMK firmware's internal keymap, which is defined in either `src/keymap.rs` or `keyboard.toml`.

It's important to understand the difference:

- `vial.json`: Defines the keyboard layout recognized by Vial, which specifies the position of each key that Vial sets.
- `src/keymap.rs` / `keyboard.toml`: Defines the actual layout and keymap in the firmware, which specifies the action for each key press.

:::

Once you have your `vial.json` file, simply place it in the root directory of your RMK firmware project. RMK will automatically handle the rest..

## Disable Vial

Vial support requires additional Flash and RAM. If you want to minimize binary size and memory usage, you can disable Vial support.

When using `keyboard.toml`, you can disable Vial by setting `vial_enabled` to `false` under the `[rmk]` section. To completely remove Vial from the build, also disable the `vial` feature in your `Cargo.toml` by turning off the default features:

```toml title="keyboard.toml"
[rmk]
vial_enabled = false
```

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
rmk = { version = "...", default-features = false }
```
