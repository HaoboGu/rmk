//! Input device module for RMK
//!
//! This module defines the `InputDevice` trait, `InputProcessor` trait, `Runnable` trait and several macros for running input devices and processors.
//! The `InputDevice` trait provides the interface for individual input devices, and the macros facilitate their concurrent execution.

/// This trait defines the interface for input devices in RMK.

/// struct MyInputDevice;
///
/// impl InputDevice for MyInputDevice {
///     async fn read_event(&mut self) -> Event {
///         // Input device implementation

/// This macro simplifies the creation of a task that reads events from multiple input devices

/// input events in a concurrent manner.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `dev`: A list of input devices grouped in parentheses.
/// * `channel`: The channel that devices send the events to.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// use rmk::channel::{blocking_mutex::raw::NoopRawMutex, channel::Channel, EVENT_CHANNEL};
/// // Initialize channel
/// let local_channel: Channel<NoopRawMutex, Event, 16> = Channel::new();
///
/// // Define your input devices, both MyInputDevice and MyInputDevice2 should implement `InputDevice] trait
/// struct MyInputDevice;
/// struct MyInputDevice2;
///
/// let d1 = MyInputDevice{};
/// let d2 = MyInputDevice2{};
/// // Bind devices to channels and run, RMK also provides EVENT_CHANNEL for general use
/// let device_future = run_devices! {
///     (d1, d2) => local_channel,
