//! Azoteq IQS5xx trackpad controller driver.
//!
//! This IC is commonly used in keyboards via Azoteq's TPS43 and TPS65 modules.
//!
//! # Communication
//!
//! ```text
//!
//! RDY    | low     | high    | low     | high    |
//! mode   | scan    | I2C     | scan    | I2C     |
//!                  |<-- report rate -->|
//! ```
//!
//! The device operates in cycles. It drives the `RDY` pin high to indicate
//! (§8.1) that scanning/processing is complete and an I2C communication window
//! is open. The window lasts until RMK sends an "end session" command (§8.7)
//! or the I2C timeout is hit (§8.6). The device then restarts scanning/processing
//! to prepare for the next window. It attempts to open a window once every
//! "report rate" (more accurately, report *interval*, as it's measured in
//! milliseconds; §4.1), setting the `RR_MISSED` bit if it's not able to keep up.
//!
//! If RMK requests "event mode", the I2C communication window is skipped
//! entirely when there's no event of interest.
//!
//! RMK can force a communication window to open; the device "clock stretches"
//! until it is able to respond.
//!
//! Report intervals vary based on configuration and mode (active and four
//! successively deeper idle states).
//!
//! In the best case, IQS550 reports are at a rate of ~100 Hz / interval of ~10
//! ms. Notably, this is long enough that (unlike with trackball controllers
//! supported by RMK) it's not necessary to aggregate several reports into one
//! USB HID mouse report. In fact the opposite may be preferred: spreading one
//! report across several USB HID reports for smooth scrolling.
//!
//! # `RDY` vs polling
//!
//! This driver supports usage with or without a `RDY` (ready/motion) pin.
//! Routing such a pin (even by hand-soldering a wire onto an existing PCB) is
//! recommended, particularly if the I2C bus is shared with another device. As
//! mentioned above, sending an I2C command outside a communication window will
//! cause it to respond by I2C clock-stretching, essentially freezing the bus
//! for all devices until it is ready. If RMK communicates promptly after `RDY`
//! goes high, this is unlikely to happen. When RMK just guesses when to
//! communicate based on timing, it's far more likely. It's possible to minimize
//! chances of a stall by making the report interval relatively consistent, but
//! this requires compromises:
//!
//! 1. requesting a conservative report rate: experimentally, even though the
//!    IQS550 advertises "typical report rate: 100 Hz (with single touch /
//!    all channels active)", it will miss targets shorter than ~14 ms (~70 Hz)
//!    during longer touch events.
//! 2. perhaps giving extra time beyond the requested cycle time before polling,
//!    lowering the duty cycle, and raising the communication window timeout to
//!    compensate.
//! 3. preventing transition to idle modes or setting their cycle times to match
//!    the active mode.
//! 4. disabling event mode.
//! 5. disabling auto-tuning during operation (re-ATI).
//!
//! # Reported data
//!
//! The IC exposes (§5.2, §6):
//!
//! * single-finger relative cursor movement (§5.2.2)
//! * per-finger absolute position, pressure, and area (§5.2.3-§5.2.5)
//! * detected gestures (§6): single/two-finger tap, press-and-hold, swipes,
//!   scroll, zoom/pinch
//! * raw per-channel count/delta data (§8.10.6)
//!
//! This driver currently requests only the 10-byte motion block at 0x000C
//! (previous cycle time, gesture events, system info, number of fingers,
//! relative XY) and publishes relative XY as cursor movement. Gestures are
//! left disabled on the IC; absolute finger data and raw channel data are
//! not read.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! The Azoteq driver supports a variety of configuration, including parameters of
//! the physical touchpad and configuration of gesture recognition.
//!
//! * Some of these can be configured persistently shortly after resetting the
//!   device via the `NRST` pin. This driver does not support that mechanism.
//! * All can be configured at runtime. Currently this driver hardcodes a few of these.
//!
